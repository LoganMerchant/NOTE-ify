## Installation
No installation is necessary for this project. Simply navigate to [Heroku](https://intense-brushlands-14855.herokuapp.com/).


## Usage
Once you navigate to the webpage, click on the `Get Started` button. You will then see a list of saved notes to the left-hand side of the page. Clicking on one of these will display the note's title and text on the right-hand side. If you'd like to add a note, click on the pencil icon in the top left corner of the page. Once a new note's title and text are input, a save icon will appear next to the pencil - click this to save. In order to delete a note, simply click the red trash icon next to note you wish to delete.


## Tests
The tests for this page can be found the `__tests__` folder. They make sure that the functions within `lib` are working properly. At the time of this writing, the only two functions being tested are the ones responsible for creating and deleting notes - `createNote` and `findById` respectively.
    

## How to Contribute
Future contributions to this project should expand upon the data being stored in a note, i.e. having optional categories for the notes to be grouped into, for example. If you would like to contribute or run more ideas for the application by me, you can find my info below.
